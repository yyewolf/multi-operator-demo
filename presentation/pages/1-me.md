💻 I'm one of the main actors in the **development of Kubernetes Operators**  
of our new hosting platform.    

🚀 Our goal?  

To provide an **easy-to-use** platform from both the consumer and developer standpoints.

❓ How so ?

By turning complex configurations into clean declarative specs and transforming an async-first platform into a (somewhat) reactive platform.
