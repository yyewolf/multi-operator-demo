## The Platform We're Building

We're building a **new hosting product** that:

- Relies heavily on **Kubernetes** and **Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)**
- Is powered by **multiple Operators**, each with its own concern
- Aims to provide **developer-friendly abstractions**  
  while maintaining **production-grade flexibility**

Operators are at the heart of this platform â€”  
and that's where the fun (and weirdness) begins.
